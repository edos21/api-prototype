# api-prototype

This is the prototype implementation for the proposed scenario.
It was made with Python using Flask as framework, runing on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ it has no Database so all Reviews will be saved locally and will be lost when the local server quits.

The variables and methods name used are self explanatory.
For any doubt, don't hessitate on contacting me
